Control your Game Frame with just a few taps from inside the app or from the provided Widgets and Quick Tiles<sup>1</sup>.

Select from a plethora of tools, use layers and palettes from many classic systems you love, in order to create your own 16x16 pixel art and upload it to your GameFrame with the tap of a button.
